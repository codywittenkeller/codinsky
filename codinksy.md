## Creating Style-Transfer of Art using TensorFlow / Python 
**Project description:** This short scripts takes a list of personalized art drawings (in my case one of my favorite personal hand-drawings) and creates a directory full of new versions of the drawing with as many new styles as desired. For this example I created 9 different versions of my "Taste Experience O1" using 9 of my favorite Wassily Kandinsky paintings.
